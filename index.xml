      <description>Dear reader, Taking walks after lunch, mostly alone but occasionally with friends, has been one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made in college. I used to approach college with a keep-your-foot-on-the-gas-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-good mentality. Not working was bad and a waste of time. Then the unsustainability of it all hit me around my third year. It was only halfway through the year, and I woke up every day feeling burned out, worn out.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&#39;m Olivia. I&#39;m a second-year PhD student in Computer Science working with Professor Ryan Kastner at UC San Diego. My research centers on computer architecture, focusing on end-of-Moore&#39;s-Law computing vis-Ã -vis hardware acceleration.
Before coming to UCSD, I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Professor Yanjing Li on mitigating cache side-channel attacks while maintaining cache performance and Professor Andrew A. Chien on integrating SSD latency predictors into cloud systems via hardware accelerators.</description>

      <description>ResNet Reshaper: Reshaping Residual Networks for Resource-Efficient Inference on FPGAs Residual networks (ResNets) employ skip connections in their networks&amp;mdash;reusing activations from previous layers&amp;mdash;to improve training convergence, but these skip connections create challenges for hardware implementations of ResNets. In particular, they are problematic for inference accelerators on resource-limited platforms because they introduce a bottleneck during inference: the layers whose activations are reused in future layers must wait for this reuse to occur before accepting new input and continuing to compute.</description>
