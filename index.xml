      <description>Dear reader, Taking walks after lunch, mostly alone but occasionally with friends, has been one of the best decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made in college. I used to approach college with a keep-your-foot-on-the-gas-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-good mentality. Not working was bad and a waste of time. Then the unsustainability of it all hit me around my third year. It was only halfway through the year, and I woke up every day feeling burned out, worn out.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Olivia. I&amp;rsquo;m a sixth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science working with Professor Ryan Kastner at UC San Diego. My research focuses on using hardware-software co-design to create efficient, fault-tolerant computer architectures for machine learning. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Before coming to UCSD, I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Professor Yanjing Li on mitigating cache side-channel attacks and Professor Andrew A.</description>

      <description>PrioriFI: Efficient Fault Injection for Edge Neural Networks As neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used to provide edge intelligence, there is a growing need to make the edge devices that run them robust to faults. Edge devices must mitigate the resulting hardware failures to function correctly. In addition, edge NNs have strict constraints on power, energy, latency, throughput, memory size, and computational resources. Edge NNs require fundamental changes in model architecture, e.</description>
